# Images

The paintings are the product. Everything here is a functional requirement.

## Never crop a painting

This is the single hardest rule in the repo.

The works come in wildly mixed aspect ratios — currently nine portrait between
0.62 and 0.79, five near-square between 0.95 and 1.03, and one landscape at 1.47.
That mix is normal for a painter and will get wider, not narrower.

Therefore:
- Every grid card is a **fixed-size container**, and the painting is **fitted**
  inside it at its own aspect ratio, centred, with padding around it.
- Rows stay aligned because the containers are equal — not because the images
  were forced to match.
- `object-fit: cover` on a painting is a bug. So is a fixed `aspect-ratio` on the
  image itself, and so is any crop applied at the image-service level.
- The padding around a fitted painting is the mat, visually. Treat it as part of
  the design, not as leftover space.

`components/ui/ArtworkFrame.js` owns this. `.frame` carries the shared
`aspect-ratio`; the painting is centred inside a `.mat` that is
`position: absolute`, with `max-width`/`max-height: 100%`.

**The mat must stay out of normal flow.** In normal flow the image's intrinsic
height beats the frame's `aspect-ratio` and stretches the box, so cards come out
at different heights and the grid goes ragged — measured at 340px to 402px tall
across one twelve-card grid before it was fixed. This is the bug this rule exists
to prevent, and it does not look obviously wrong until you measure it.

## Real dimensions are read, never typed

`scripts/generate-image-manifest.mjs` parses the JPEG/PNG headers of everything
in `public/paintings/` and writes real width and height into
`lib/data/image-manifest.json`. It runs on `prebuild`, so the manifest cannot
drift from what is on disk.

Never hardcode a painting's pixel dimensions. If you add or replace an image,
run `npm run images:manifest`.

The layout needs those numbers precisely because it must not crop: to reserve
the right box before the image loads, and to avoid layout shift.

## Current images are stand-ins

Every file in `public/paintings/` is a WhatsApp-compressed copy capped at 1600px,
and two of them are far smaller than that. They are fine for development and
design.

**Replacing them with proper photography is a launch blocker.** Placeholder
images are allowed in development; they are not allowed in public.

Do not design around their softness. Build the layout for large, sharp images —
`next.config.mjs` already declares device and image sizes for the replacements
rather than for what is in the repo today. A design that hides low resolution
behind small thumbnails will waste the good photographs when they arrive.

## Every painting gets more than one image

The model carries an ordered image collection with three types:

- `main` — the flat frontal shot. The one in the grid and at the top of the page.
- `detail` — a close-up of the brushwork at an angle. This is what proves the
  work is a physical object rather than a print, and it sells.
- `in-situ` — the painting hanging on a wall, for scale. A buyer cannot translate
  "50×70 cm" into a mental picture; this is a real conversion driver.

Only `main` exists today. Build the artwork page so the others slot in without
a redesign.

## Delivery

Today: files in `public/paintings/`, served through Next's built-in image
optimisation. Later: Cloudinary, swapped behind the same components.

Always use Next's image component rather than a bare `<img>`, always supply real
width and height from the manifest, and mark the hero image as priority. Nothing
below the fold should be eager.

## Alt text

Alt text is content, so it is bilingual and lives with the work, not hardcoded.
Describe the painting — subject, medium — not the fact that it is an image.
